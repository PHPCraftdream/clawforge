// Checks that --help actually shows help for the framework-level pseudo-commands —
// new-app, control-mcp, help itself — instead of running the real thing. Also checks that
// `./clawforge help` works in a checkout with no deployments at all, before any app.ts exists to
// load commands from.
//
// control-mcp is the sharp edge: before this was fixed, `./clawforge control-mcp --help` started
// the real MCP server and waited on stdin forever, since --help was only checked for
// commands looked up in app.commands, and control-mcp is dispatched before that lookup
// ever runs. A hang can't be told apart from a slow process without a real timeout, so
// this spawns the real gate (tools/clawforge.ts) with a bounded wait rather than asserting on a
// direct function call.
