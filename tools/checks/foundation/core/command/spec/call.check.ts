// The normalized call form (stage 7 S2.2), table-driven over every command that declares
// actions, derived from the declarations alone. For every action: the console parse asserts
// the SELECTED action's name, the binder binds the named call, toArgv names the action
// first (legacy), and the rendered help's action-choices list is exactly the declared set.
// A positional another action owns, an unknown action and a bare call are refused with one
// text — the console's — and the refusal texts are judged structurally (voice tokens
// spelled here, never the product formatter's own constants). validate/toArgv are legacy;
// the named surface binds through bindNamed — one order of checks, one first refusal, the
// console's words. The unknown-action cases are then answered by the real named MCP
// dispatch (a real serveMcp over the real declarations), and an Object.prototype member is
// never a declared action.
