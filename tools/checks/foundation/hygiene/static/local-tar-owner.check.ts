// Local-tar ownership hygiene for tools/framework, enforced as an invariant: the single
// owner of LOCAL tar spawns is tools/framework/set/artifacts/tar.ts — no other file may
// hand a local process runner the literal program "tar" (tar over ctx.transport runs on
// the target and is legitimate). The owner itself must pass every "-C" value through
// tarLocalPath(...) (rf6-fix33). The analysis lives in local-tar-rules.ts; this file
// self-checks it on in-memory snippets, then scans the real tree. ALLOW is empty and must
// stay empty — a hit fails by name; legitimate shapes are handled by tightening the rule,
// never by allow-listing.
