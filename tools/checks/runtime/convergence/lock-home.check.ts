//
// The bug this guards is one that reads correctly and does the opposite: `sudo -n sh -c
// 'chown "$(id -u):$(id -g)" <dir>'` evaluates the substitution in the shell sudo started —
// root's — so it hands the directory to 0:0 and the ordinary user still cannot create a
// lock. The preparation appeared to work, and left the exact state it exists to prevent.
//
// So the assertions are about the shape of what reaches the target, not about the outcome
// of a run: numeric ids, resolved before any escalation, passed as plain arguments.
