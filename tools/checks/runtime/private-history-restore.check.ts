// P1-02 of docs/review-2026-09-22-xa-round-3.md: the privacy ledger lives operator-side at
// <deployment>/config/private-paths.json, but a full backup publishes a copy into the data
// root at <dataDir>/config/clawforge-private-paths.json (createArchive, profile "full"), and
// restoreArchive imports it back into the deployment ledger after verifyRestoredLayout.
//
// The ledger describes the target while living on the operator side, so recording a private
// write used to help only while the backup was restored through the very deployment directory
// the write was recorded in. A restore through a different one — a new folder, a lost one,
// another machine managing the same target — arrived with the data and none of its history,
// and the next migrate/share built its exclusions from an empty record: fail-closed for a
// ledger that exists but cannot be read is still fail-open for one that is simply not there.
//
// Part A drives the ledger/history contract itself — the publish unit (including the
// adopt-existing-target and explicit-forget-still-clears-both-copies scenarios of P2-01,
// docs/review-2026-09-23-xs-round-4.md), the import's merge and its two refusals. It needs no
// target and runs everywhere.
// Part B is the whole scenario over real GNU tar and a real POSIX filesystem (LocalTransport
// off Windows, a WSL distribution on it): a real private write through the fixture recipe's
// prepare hook, a full backup, then a restore through a DIFFERENT, fresh operator-side
// deployment with NO recipes — the written file is still classified private (excluded from
// share, refused by verify) — a corrupt history copy fails the restore with the previous data
// put back, and a repeated restore changes nothing. The lesson of the 2026-09-21 audit
// stands: a simulated tar cannot contradict the code it was modelled on.

  // === PART C — P2-02 (audit 2026-09-23 round 4): a failure staged AFTER the history import
  // succeeded must undo that import along with the data tree =========================================
  //
  // importRestoredHistory runs before fresh-identity and ensureDataDirs, inside the try whose
  // catch puts the data tree back from `aside` — but nothing put the ledger back too. A
  // failure in ensureDataDirs (after a successful import) used to leave deployment B's ledger
  // holding entries from an archive the restore ultimately rejected, so the OLD instance came
  // out of a failed restore with policy boundaries from an unaccepted archive. Driven with a
  // stub transport — the failure pinned down here is ensureDataDirs' own chmod, which no real
  // archive can trigger on demand, so this is genuinely a different failure point than Part
  // B's corrupt-history case above (which fails INSIDE the import, before anything is written).
