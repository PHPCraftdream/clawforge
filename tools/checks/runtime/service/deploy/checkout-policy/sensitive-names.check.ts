// access reads as ENOENT and is (correctly) tolerated, fs.readdir of the file reports
// ENOTDIR. No errno is asserted, because which call fails first is the platform's

// name inside a recipe or config/ already refused the whole deploy. One table of
// sensitive-name shapes, three locations each, one required outcome.

// The checkout-root scan reads a SYNTHETIC source root via the CLAWFORGE_CHECKS_SOURCE_ROOT
