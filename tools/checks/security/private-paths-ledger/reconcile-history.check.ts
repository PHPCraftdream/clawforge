// P1-04 and P2-04 of docs/review-2026-09-23-xxa-round-6.md: the privacy history has TWO
// copies — the operator-side ledger at <deployment>/config/private-paths.json and the
// target-side copy at <dataDir>/config/clawforge-private-paths.json — and every reader that
// never publishes used to ask only the first one.
//
// P1-04: a deployment folder pointed at already-existing target data — a lost or freshly
// recreated one, another machine adopting the same instance — reaches migrate or share with
// no restore and no full backup ever run, and built its exclusions from a record that was
// not there. createArchive() now reconciles the target copy into the ledger before the
// policy is read, and the forget became a state of the ledger's own protocol — tombstones
// — so "deliberately forgotten" and "history missing" can no longer be confused, including
// by a failed restore's rollback, which used to fabricate an empty ledger file (a witness
// to a forget nobody asked for) where none had existed.
//
// P2-04: publishPrivatePathsHistory wrote the target copy through the private writer,
// which is an EXCLUSIVE create on every real transport — the second full backup died
// against the copy the first one had just written, and the republish after an adoption hit
// the same wall. It is now an atomic replace that skips the write when the bytes are
// already identical.
//
// Part A drives the tombstone protocol and reconcile against fake transports: the ledger
// and the target copy never meet a real filesystem, so every answer is the fake's and the
// assertions are about the protocol alone (adoption, suppression, the legacy-empty shape,
// the two loud refusals, the no-op). Part B pins the rollback's fidelity through
// restoreArchive with a stub transport whose staged failure lands exactly after a
// successful history import — absence must roll back to absence, a tombstone to itself.
// Part C drives the publish against a REAL LocalTransport, where the replace, the
// byte-identical skip and the old copy's survival of a failed write are the filesystem's
// own answers, not a fake's. Part D is the audit's own scenario end to end over a real
// POSIX filesystem and real GNU tar: a fresh operator folder straight to migrate/share
// against a target that carries its history, then two sequential full backups. Checks
// share one process, so the deployments and recipes roots this file selects are restored
// in the finally.
