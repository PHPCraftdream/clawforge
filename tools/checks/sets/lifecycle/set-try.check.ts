// deployment's Context had built up. set try already saves and restores setSourceDir() this
// same way (previousSource, a few lines above the finally block this mirrors); it must do
// the identical thing for composeProjectOverride(), or a composite command that keeps using
// the original Context after set try returns addresses Docker under the wrong project name.
// Building a throwaway Context that actually gets far enough to exercise this needs a real,
// checksum-valid set artifact — out of proportion for confirming a save/restore pair already
// proven correct at the primitive level (tools/checks/foundation/core/deployment-names.check.ts).
// What this guards against is a future edit silently dropping the restore call.
