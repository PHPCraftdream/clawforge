      "not running, erroring or not connected\n" +

      "verified on OpenClaw 2026.6.34 — that CLI has no dead-letter/delivery-failure " +
      "signal, only connection/auth trouble, so that is all this reports),\n" +
      "and DISK_LOW/DISK_UNKNOWN for the data directory's free space against " +
      "OC_WATCH_DISK_MIN_MB (default 1024 MB; degraded below it, down below 10% of it or " +
      "100 MB, whichever is higher; DISK_UNKNOWN — always degraded, never a silent ok — " +
      "when `df` itself fails or cannot be parsed).\n" +
      "All of this collapses into ok / degraded / down.\n" +

      "no data directory yet to measure).\n" +
      "Compared against this machine's deployment history (atomic write), serialized across " +
      "processes through delivery and persistence; a busy cycle reports contention. SSH operator " +

      "A webhook POST (OC_WATCH_WEBHOOK in " +
      "this deployment's .env, https only unless it is localhost) fires only on a " +
      "TRANSITION, so an unchanged state never pages anyone twice.\n" +
      "A failed POST leaves the persisted level at its old value on purpose, so the same " +
      "unreported transition is retried next cycle instead of being silently accepted as " +
      "normal — but the failure itself, and when it happened, is now recorded (`watch " +

      "A configuration error (a bad OC_WATCH_WEBHOOK/OC_WATCH_WEBHOOK_FORMAT/" +
