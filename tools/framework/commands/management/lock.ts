//
// config/desired-state.json reproduces the *settings*, not which framework wrote them,
// which image ran (a tag moves, a digest doesn't), or which recipe content version the
// agent answered from. Two instances can satisfy the same declaration and not be the same
// instance.
//
// Meant to be committed, so it holds no secret values — only variable names.
