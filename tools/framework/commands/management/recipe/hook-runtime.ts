 *  serving a stale hook after a dependency changes on disk.
 *
 *  The checksum decides *whether* a reload is due; a versioned URL decides *what gets
 *  re-executed*: importHookModule stamps it as `?g=<checksum>` on the hook's real file
 *  URL, and ./hook-loader.ts's resolve hook re-stamps the same version onto every
 *  specifier reached through relative resolution. A change anywhere in the graph thus
 *  changes every versioned URL at once, so Node re-executes the whole graph; unchanged,
 *  this map answers without importing.
 *
 *  Hooks execute from their real location (no copy to temp): bare imports resolve
 *  against the recipe's package scope, `#imports` resolve through the recipe's own
 *  package.json imports map (hook-graph.ts folds package.json + resolved target into
 *  the checksum; anything it can't safely track — bare package target, absolute path,
 *  `..` escape, symlink, unsupported condition — is refused before the hook executes). */
