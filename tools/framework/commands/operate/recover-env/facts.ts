// The four .env values that are plumbing, not secrets, and which of them the running
// container still carries. Shared by recover-env (repairs a stale .env) and inspect's
// ENV_STALE finding (reports one), so there is one answer to "is the .env stale".
//
// Compose resolved all four from that same .env at container-creation time, so the running
// container holds the answers; the file mixes them with a real secret
// (OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN), so everything these functions return is variable NAMES — a value
// from the parsed file never crosses this module's boundary.
//
// A disagreement between the two sides keeps two readings apart, since they demand opposite
// remedies: a name the .env lacks entirely is unambiguous (filling it cannot overwrite a
// decision); different values for a name both sides carry is equally consistent with a
// rotted file or a deliberate edit the container has not caught up with yet.
