// `clawforge recover-env` — repairs .env's CONNECTION FACTS (OC_DATA_DIR,
// OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT, OC_COMPOSE_PROJECT, OPENCLAW_IMAGE) from the running container,
// which compose resolved from that same .env at creation time.
//
// Which side is authoritative when file and container disagree is undecidable here, so by
// default only the unambiguous case is written — a name the file lacks entirely. Diverged
// values are reported, never overwritten, unless --adopt-runtime takes the container as
// authoritative. The opposite direction (file is right) needs `up` to recreate.
// A wholly absent .env cannot be repaired: reaching the target requires the .env that names it.
// Declared as a body with needs: "deployment": the pipeline (core/command/execute.ts) builds
// the deployment scope — transport from .env, no Context — and refuses a missing .env in the
// prepare stage. recoverEnv(ctx, args) stays for the apply step, which already has a Context.
