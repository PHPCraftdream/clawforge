// `./clawforge set build` — collect everything a deployment installs into ONE artifact.
// The vocabulary (manifest, the three entities set/instance/state, content id) lives in
// set/model.ts; the collection itself is the loader in set/load.ts (one pipeline for tree
// and artifact alike), and this is the packer that feeds it, written to sets/<name>-<id>.tar.gz.
//
// A set builds with NO running instance, so target-side readers are never used here —
// ctx.transport and ctx.runtime are untouched; only ctx.settings (declared image) is read.
