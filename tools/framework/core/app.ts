// Application API: how code is driven by this framework, from console and MCP. The
// framework handles transport, path translation, and container operation; an application
// supplies its own settings, commands, and secrets. Minimal example:
//
//   export default defineApp({
//     name: "hello",
//     description: "Example",
//     commands: { ping: { summary: "...", run: async (ctx) => { ... } } },
//   });
