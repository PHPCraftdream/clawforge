// kind, so the property sweep derives its cases from the declaration instead of guessing a
// value per argument. `parse` keeps today's byte-identical refusal text (each constructor
// wraps the parser the command uses now); read grammars never reject values the framework
// already wrote (I14 — see the `hostId` decision).
