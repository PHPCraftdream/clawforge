// Which framework runs a deployment when `clawforge` is the system-wide command.
//
// The deployment's own framework wins, so one global install serves every app without
// changing any of them: a local @clawforge/framework dependency (the app's version pin),
// or — for apps/<name> and the root of a ClawForge checkout — that checkout's own gate.
// Only an app with neither runs on the global package itself, whose @clawforge/framework
// imports then resolve to that package. Two framework copies in one process would split
// module state (the selected deployment, registered secrets), so it is always one or the other.
