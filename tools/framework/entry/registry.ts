// One list for every surface a gate presents. tools/clawforge.ts and framework/entry/bin.ts

// place, and a name-reading surface (help, completion, documentation, the structural checks)
// reads surfaceRegistry — the one command registry — so there is no second hand list of gate
// names to keep in step. Declarations live where they always did (entry/checkout-gate.ts,
// integration/version.ts, integration/completion.ts, integration/deployment/init.ts); this only
// sequences them and closes completion over the finished array, itself included.
