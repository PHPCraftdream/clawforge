// Creating a new deployment under apps/ (or the check-only override — appsRootFor).
// Listing existing ones is list.ts, which shares
// this file's appsDir.
//
// A deployment is a directory of configuration, not a codebase: .env, desired state,
// secret stores, recipes, and an app.ts saying which service it manages. The framework
// supplies the logic. Usable measure: the generated deployment must run immediately after
// its .env is filled in.
//
// npm distribution: `declarationFor()` below hardcodes `"../../tools/framework/..."`
// relative imports, correct only when app.ts sits two levels under monorepoRoot next to
// tools/ — monorepo-only, should stay that way. The installed-as-dependency init command
// has its own template (init.ts), importing the package specifier instead.
