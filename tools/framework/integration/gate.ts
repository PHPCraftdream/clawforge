// .env). Dispatched by the gate (tools/clawforge.ts, framework/entry/bin.ts), not cli.ts's
// dispatcher, but still declared like a capability of the gate: one declaration feeds
// dispatch, `--help` and the MCP tool list, so help text lives in the declaration, not as
// literal strings at each call site.

// Which entries exist depends on the gate: `new-app` belongs to the monorepo one, `init` to
// the installed one (exactly one deployment, at the repo root), `check` needs this
// repository's own test suite, which the npm package doesn't ship. Each gate builds its own list.
