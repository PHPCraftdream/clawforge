// Exposing an application's commands as MCP tools.
//
// Not the bridge to the managed service's own channels — that belongs to the application.
// This server offers *control* of the instance: bootstrap, status, backup, secrets.
//
// The surface is a mirror: what the gate can do from a terminal, a tool call can do.
// Three tiers reach the console and all three are mirrored — the application's own commands
// (app.commands, dispatched in cli.ts); the dispatcher's (help, control-mcp); the gate's,
// which run before a deployment is resolved (check, new-app / init). A command whose
// console behaviour cannot survive being a tool call (it streams, or owns stdio) is
// mirrored in a bounded form declared beside it. What cannot be mirrored at all is listed
// in MCP_EXEMPTIONS below with the reason; tools/checks/mcp-mirror.check.ts fails on
// anything that is neither.
//
// stdout carries JSON-RPC and nothing else. Commands write progress to stderr through the
// log helpers, so that output is captured as the tool result instead of corrupting the
// protocol stream.
