// Where a deployment keeps its own files.
//
// An application is a deployment: its .env, desired state, secret stores, recipes and
// snapshots live in one directory, and several deployments can sit side by side sharing this
// framework. Nothing here may be resolved against the repository root, or two deployments
// would silently share one configuration. The gate sets the directory before any command runs.
//
// DESIGN NOTE — npm distribution (see env.ts for the matching note). A directory is handed
// in once by whatever the entry point is, and everything else derives from it, never from
// the framework's own location: monorepo mode resolves `apps/<name>` and calls
// `useDeployment()`; installed-as-dependency mode has exactly one app at its own project
// root. This file does not need to know which mode produced the directory.
