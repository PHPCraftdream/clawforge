//   - the provider key exists only in config/.env
//   - config/identity/device-auth.json holds an operator token with read/write scopes
//   - state/openclaw.sqlite has a multi-megabyte -wal sibling, so a copy taken while the
//     gateway writes is not restorable — hence the stop before snapshotting
//   - workspace/.git matters: the agent versions its own memory there
