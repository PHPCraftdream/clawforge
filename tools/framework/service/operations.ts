// What a mutating run did, written down while it happens.
//
// The `apply` command reports its steps, and the report is gone: the terminal scrolls, an
// MCP result is read once, and a run that died halfway leaves nothing behind. So the
// record lives on the target beside the instance, and each step is written as it finishes
// — a killed run still leaves everything up to that step.
//
// The id is the operation's, not a formatting detail: it goes into the journal entry, the
// configuration snapshot, the lock held during the run and the operationId an MCP caller
// gets back — one value ties them together.
