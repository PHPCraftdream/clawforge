// ours. Leftovers from previous versions then accumulate until "this instance is the set"
// stops being true in a way no command can see.
//
// The alternative — inferring ownership from names, or assuming everything present is ours —
// is worse in both directions. Assume too much and the framework deletes an MCP server
// someone registered by hand; assume too little and nothing is ever cleaned up. So it is
// written down at the moment of creation, which is the only moment the answer is known for
// certain.
//
// The ledger lives in the data directory, and that is deliberate: it describes what is IN
// that directory, so it must travel with a restore. A ledger kept beside the deployment
// would, after a restore from another host, describe objects that are not there and miss the
// ones that are.
